📊 Daily Temperature Analysis 🌡️

Welcome to the Daily Temperature Analysis repository! This project automates the generation, analysis, and visualization of daily temperature data using Python. The goal of this project is to showcase the integration of data analysis, visualization, and version control through Git.

🔍 Project Overview:
This repository contains a Python script that generates random temperature data for a day and plots it using the Matplotlib library. The temperature data is updated every 5 hours, and the resulting plot is automatically pushed to this repository. The project demonstrates how to schedule tasks using Windows Task Scheduler to automate data analysis and Git commits.

🚀 Features:
- Automated generation and visualization of random temperature data.
- Scheduled data analysis and Git push to update the repository.
- Utilizes Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- A showcase of effective use of version control with Git and GitHub.

📋 Usage:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment and install required dependencies.
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Schedule the `daily_temperature_analysis.py` script using Windows Task Scheduler.
4. Watch as the temperature plot is updated and automatically pushed to this repository.
